For example, here is what the new ``searcher.py`` looks like (``analyzer.py`` and ``writer.py`` should be obvious)
cat saw/searcher.py # cat tutorial/reorg/saw/searcher.py
While ``common.py`` contains the common defintions
cat saw/common.py # cat tutorial/reorg/saw/common.py
Everything works as before. For example
figura_print saw.searcher.keywords # figura_print reorg.saw.searcher.keywords
