For example, here is what the new ``searcher.fig`` looks like (``analyzer.fig`` and ``writer.fig`` should be obvious)
cat saw/searcher.fig # cat tutorial/reorg/saw/searcher.fig
While ``common.fig`` contains the common defintions
cat saw/common.fig # cat tutorial/reorg/saw/common.fig
Everything works as before. For example
figura_print saw.searcher.keywords # figura_print reorg.saw.searcher.keywords
