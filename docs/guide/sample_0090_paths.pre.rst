Paths to Config Files
=========================

In most cases, the path you provide to indicate which config file to read is the Pythoh-import path.
E.g., reading config from path ``<<X>>`` roughly translates to the python statement ``import <<X>>``.

However, figura supports dealing with "deep" paths which go inside the config file.
