polyloader
==================

The "polyloader" package is included in the Figura codebase *temporarily*,
until additions and fixes required for Figura to work correctly are pulled
into the main polyloader project (https://github.com/elfsternberg/polyloader).

It is planned to be removed in the next Figura version, and added to requirements.txt.

In any case, *all credit for the awesome polyloader library goes to @elfsternberg*.
